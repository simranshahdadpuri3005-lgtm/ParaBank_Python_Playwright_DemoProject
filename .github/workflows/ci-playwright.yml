#we have to makesure the folder structure is same .github\workflows\any_name.yml file
# yml file is used by github actions to understand to understand the pipeline configurations
#basically the steps that any other machine user would require to run the tests
#clone project, then install python, if not yet done,then create pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  schedule:
    -cron: "0 18 * * *"   #format: min hr day month day-of-week (UTC)

# the below execution will happen whenever the push is made to main branch
#any cicd pipeline cannot trigger in headed mode and hence it should be headless mode
